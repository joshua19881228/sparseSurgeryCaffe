# sparseSurgeryCaffe

A tool will be implemented to operate a surgery to "sparsify" caffemodels according to config files. The source code can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/joshua19881228/sparseSurgeryCaffe).

Recently, many works about pruning CNN to accelerate inference have been published, such as [Net-Trim](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05162), [NISP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05908) and [ThiNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06342). The being implemented tool can be used to operate the surgery of pruning  CNN based on Caffe toolkit.
